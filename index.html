                <p>As the Mechanical Lead of the Olin Electric Formula SAE team, I guide my peers to create reliable, unique, and testable designs. My creative passion is pottery, specifically wheel throwing.</p>
                <p>I’m also interested in cooking; my favorite creation will always be croissants because of the effort and technique required to make them.</p>
